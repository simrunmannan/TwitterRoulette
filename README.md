TwitterRoulette
Twitter Roulette is a social commentary on how, with a click of a button, random and sometimes unnecessary information is submitted onto the internet. When the button is clicked, a Twitter Bot known as Cyan Slayter initates randomly generated tweets on the internet. It's a game of roulette because the player may launch good or bad tweets. The idea here is to think before you act because it's worth the thought.
